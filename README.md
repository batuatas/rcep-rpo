# LP Portfolio Optimization

## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of **Portfolio Optimization** using two different approaches:
1. **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) Model** (implemented in `lp_portfolio.py`) as a LP Model
2. **Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) Model** (implemented in `mvo_portfolio.py`) as a quadratic model offered by Markovitz

Additionally, the repository includes a script (`financial_data_obtain.py`) for fetching and preparing financial data from Yahoo Finance.
